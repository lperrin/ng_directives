Talk - Dive in AngularJS Directives
===================================

This is the code used to support my talk about AngularJS Directives on July 25th for ngParis. The idea is to explore things you can do with directives from the point of view of an email client (because I'm working on one at the moment - more about that on http://thecompanyinbox.com).

I didn't want to do a full live-coding, so I made snapshots of the code as I was writing it (you can checkout step01 through step18).
